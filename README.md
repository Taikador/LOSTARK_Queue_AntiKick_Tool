# DESCRIPTION

The Tool has a GUI made with tkinter. You can simply run the code in your favorite IDE and a window will pop up.
You have to browse for your steam executable and then u can hit the start button. LOST ARK will start automatically.
Unfortunately it can just log into your latest server. After the queue is done the Tool will keep you connected by performing mouse clicks in Character selection.
To stop it, just close the window.

## Installation

1. Open a terminal in the path of the tool. Then use the command `poetry install` to get the libraries you need.
